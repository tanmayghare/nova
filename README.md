üéì **Educational and Experimental Project** üß™

Nova is an intelligent browser automation agent built with Python, powered by LangChain and LangGraph. This project is provided as-is for educational and experimental purposes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

This project is **not under active development** and is provided for educational and experimental use only. Features may not work as expected, and no support or updates will be provided. 

**If you're interested in developing this further, please fork the repository and create your own version.**

## üß™ What is Nova?

Nova is an AI-powered browser automation agent that demonstrates how to:
- Navigate websites and perform complex multi-step tasks
- Make intelligent decisions using Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Interact with web pages through natural language instructions
- Implement memory systems for learning from interactions
- Handle dynamic web content and adapt to changes

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Powered Decision Making**: Uses LLMs to understand and execute complex web tasks
- **Multi-Provider LLM Support**: Compatible with OpenAI, Anthropic, NVIDIA, and other providers
- **Intelligent Web Automation**: Goes beyond simple scripting with context-aware actions
- **Memory System**: Demonstrates learning from previous interactions
- **Flexible Architecture**: Modular design for easy customization and extension
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed monitoring and debugging capabilities

## üìã Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- A compatible LLM provider account (OpenAI, Anthropic, NVIDIA, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tanmayghare/nova.git
   cd nova
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

4. **Install Playwright browsers:**
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

5. **Configure environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and preferences
   ```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run with default task
python run_nova.py

# Run with custom task
python run_nova.py "Go to duckduckgo.com and search for 'large language models'"
```
